      <description>Since I started writing software in the 1970s, software engineering has changed out of all recognition. In the early days of the discipline, all software was developed in software projects, mostly for governments and large companies. The client specified their requirements, which were often lacking in a number of ways, and the software was developed by a separate company or group. This project oriented approach dominated software engineering for more than 30 years.</description>

      <description>A list of frequently asked questions about the book and its rationale, the target audience and their required background.
Why did you write this book? Most software engineering texts focus on project-based software engineering where a client develops a specification and the software is developed by another company. However, students mostly have experience of apps and other software products. I wanted to write about product-oriented techniques that are used in developing the kind of software that’s familiar to students.</description>

      <description>Software engineering has changed and it&amp;rsquo;s time to change what we teach to students in introductory SE courses.
My books on software engineering reflected my background and experience in the development of large, complex, custom software systems. But most software is now developed as software products and these are not developed using the same processes as custom systems. We need to revise our courses to reflect this reality.
My thinking about software engineering teaching changed radically after spending time with students working on startup companies.</description>

      <description>There have been relatively few reports of errors in the book. Thanks to Dmitry Moiseev for spotting these.
In some editions of the book (I presume the Global edition) there is an error on the very last line of section 4.5.3 where &amp;lsquo;Alternatively&amp;rsquo; has been misspelled. This is not the case for the 2020 edition, printed in the US.
On page 236 of the 2020 edition, Table 8.2 has a duplicate entry for the Facade pattern.</description>
