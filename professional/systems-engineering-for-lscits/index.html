        <h1 class="title">Course: Systems Engineering for LSCITS</h1>
        <div class="content"><p>Large-scale complex IT systems(LSCITS) are organizational systems, used by a range of stakeholders with differing goals and priorities. Their scale and complexity means that they may exhibit unexpected behaviour and performance and changing these systems can be difficult and have unpredictable consequences. Usually, LSCITS are made up of a number of other systems (sometimes, they are referred to as a system of systems) with the component systems independently managed. 
LSCITS are deeply embedded in organizational socio-technical systems and so their procurement, development and operation is influenced by human, social, organizational and cultural factors. Because of this, any analysis that is simply based on technical considerations is likely to be simplistic so we have to be aware of the socio-technical issues that affect these systems. </p>
<h2 id="aim-of-the-course">Aim of the course</h2>
<p>The aim of this course is to give you an understanding of what is meant by a large-scale complex IT system, why these are important and some of the activities that are part of LSCITS engineering.</p>
<h2 id="lectures">Lectures</h2>
<p>This short course consists of a number of presentations that introduce the notion of an LSCITS, discuss the socio-technical environment for these systems, introduce requirements engineering as a systems engineering activity and discuss the differences between LSCITS engineering and ‘conventional’ systems engineering.  Each of the presentations is a stand-alone item but, together, they make up a short introduction to systems engineering for LSCITS.</p>

<p>An introduction to a technique developed at Lancaster and St Andrews Universities, where the responsibilities of the agents in a socio-technical system are modelled. This model can then be used as a basis for generating the information requirements of these agents. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/sommervi/ultra-large-scale-systems" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra-large scale systems (ULSS)</a></p>
<p>A set of slides based on a slideset from Linda Northrop of the Software Engineering Institute where I introduce the notion of the next step up from LSCITS, namely Ultra-large Scale Systems. If you use these slides, please credit Linda and the SEI. </p>
