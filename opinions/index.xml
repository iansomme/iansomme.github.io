      <title>Disenchanted with Digital</title>

      <description>I started messing around with a camera more than 50 years ago and, then, it was all about black and white film and colour slides. I learned to process film and make prints in the darkroom and I remember the satisfaction of seeing a print emerge in a tray of developer.
Then work and family made all of this practically impossible. We lived in a small house with no room for a darkroom, buying shoes for the baby took precedence over buying Kodachrome and, for many years, my photography was point-and-shoot family snaps.</description>

      <title>Is an electric car the best way to reduce my carbon footprint?</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about whether the right thing to do is to buy an electric car or a petrol car with carbon offsetting by tree planting.
My car is now 10 years old and has done over 90, 000 miles. It’s starting to show its age and I’ve started thinking about replacing it. I want to do what I can to reduce my personal carbon footprint so I’ve been wondering about an electric car.</description>

      <title>Digital Photography: Sleepwalking into Impermanence</title>

      <description>I was reading a blog post a while ago which reflected on why we take photographs and some of the problems of digital photography (Alex Roddie: The photos you&amp;rsquo;ll never look at again). This is something that I’ve been thinking about myself and I’m not sure that I’ve come to any definite conclusion. If and when I do, I’ll blog about it.
But, for sure, one reason we take pictures is to capture memories of significant events in our lives - family events, trips and occasions.</description>

      <title>Drawing With Light</title>
      <link>https://iansommerville.com/opinions/drawing-with-light-95/</link>

      <description>The word ‘photography’ derives from two Greek roots, which roughly translated mean ‘light’ and ‘to draw’ so photography means ‘drawing with light’. It isn’t ‘copying with light’ because when photography was introduced it did not reproduce what was in front of the camera exactly as seen. Individuals draw the same scene differently, emphasising what is important to them, and until not so long ago, the same was true of photographers - they interpreted and presented what was in front of the camera in quite different ways.</description>

      <title>Photography or Digital Art</title>

      <description>When I visited Edinburgh last August, I went along to the International Exhibition of the Edinburgh Photographic Society. This is an annual event with over 3000 submissions from across the world and around about 200 acceptances. So it should represent the best of amateur photography.
Yet, when I wandered around the exhibition, I was disappointed. I reckon that at least 50% of the accepted images were ‘Digital art’, created in Photoshop or other image manipulation programs.</description>

      <title>Signs on the Hills</title>

      <description>Should there be more signposting to reduce navigation mistakes on the hills?
A tweet caught my eye a while ago about a proposal by a mountain rescue team in the Lakes to put signs up on Scafell Pike because so many people are getting lost and then calling out the mountain rescue. The reaction from the mountaineering and backpacking community was predictable outrage. Signs despoil the landscape, remove any feeling of remoteness and encourage people who don’t know what they are doing onto the hills.</description>

      <description>Should an independent Scotland consider introducing a universal basic income?
During this Coronavirus lockdown. many people, including me, have been posting on blogs and social media about their current or past lifestyle. They write about and share photographs of meals they have cooked, bread they have baked, things they have crafted and walks and holidays they have enjoyed in the past.
A perspective on posts like this that they are middle-class boasting of a lifestyle that many of our fellow citizens do not share.</description>

      <description>Why I believe that leaving the EU has the inevitable consequence of the break up of the UK?
I originally wrote this post shortly after the Brexit referendum in 2016. I set why I have changed my views on Scottish independence and why I believe that Scotland should be an independent nation that us part of the EU.
Since then, we have had years of uncertainty, the election of a right-wing, pro-Brexit government and, most significantly a global pandemic that has had immense human, social and economic consequences.</description>

      <title>Highland Spaceports - A Development Dilemma</title>

      <description>My thoughts on the development of spaceports in environmentally sensitive areas in the Scottish Highlands.
Over the past year or so, the potential of the Scottish Highlands as a suitable area for launching small rockets has been recognised with proposals for development in Sutherland, Shetland and, most recently, North Uist. My twitter feed has been full of retweets recently from outdoor folks asking me to write to the Western Isles Council opposing the North Uist development.</description>
