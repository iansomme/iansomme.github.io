      <description>One of the things I like about photography is that it encourages you to look more closely at the world. If you take a camera on a walk, you take more time and you see things you would have missed if you stride out more quickly. In these pages, I&amp;rsquo;ve included a few of the photo walks that I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed.</description>

      <title>My Deeside Way Guide</title>

      <description>We live right beside the Deeside Way, a walking and riding path that stretches from Aberdeen to Ballater (about 55km). I walk on the Way every week that we are at home and have taken hundreds if not thousands of photographs on these walks.
I decided to set myself a wee project to write a short guide to the Deeside Way that was a bit better than the rather bland description on the official website.</description>

      <description>I spent a lot of time when I was younger climbing and hill-walking all over the highlands. Nowadays, I wish I could visit more often but I try to visit in spring and autumn as well as getting to the Cairngorms a couple of times a year.</description>

      <description>Walks in the Lake District and Lancashire. We used to live in Northern England, close to the Lake District, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really started with digital photography and only took and occasional picture of my walks. We now visit friends there occasionally and sometimes I have time for a walk.</description>

      <description>My first Challenge did not start well.
As a newbie, I decided that the most sociable way to start was to catch the &amp;lsquo;Challenger Special&amp;rsquo; from Glasgow to Mallaig and this meant taking a fairly early train from Stonehaven. On our way to the station, I mentally ran through the list of what I should have with me when I realised with horror that I&amp;rsquo;d been messing around with my compass the evening before and had left it on the window ledge.</description>

      <description>The Water of Leith is a short river that runs from its source in the Pentlands to the Firth of Forth at Leith. There&amp;rsquo;s a path along most of it, starting at Balerno and finishing at Leith. It&amp;rsquo;s about 13 miles (19km) and flat so it&amp;rsquo;s an easy day&amp;rsquo;s walk.
As it&amp;rsquo;s a linear walk, I think it best to use Edinburgh&amp;rsquo;s excellent buses rather than a car to get to the start.</description>

      <description>In 2016 there was a proposal to build a 26-turbine windfarm in Glen Dye. I&amp;rsquo;d never been there and I thought that I should have a walk there before the monstrosity was built. I&amp;rsquo;m in favour of renewable energy and wind farms have their place in this. However, I think they should be built in areas of low amenity - not in wild land.
I decided to do a round trip over Clachnaben then from there drop down into Glen Dye.</description>

      <description>The TGO Challenge is an annual event where people walk across Scotland from the west to the east coast. They choose their own route and there are various meeting points, such as Braemar, where participants congregate. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken part in this 4 times (so far) and I hope to be able to do a few more.
I&amp;rsquo;ve documented my Challenges under a separate heading.

      <description>Edinburgh is unusual in the it has its own hill called Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat close to the centre of the city. It&amp;rsquo;s in Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park, a large green space at the foot of the Royal Mile. I&amp;rsquo;ve walked up Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat countless times and in all weathers apart from torrential rain.
 I normally walk up Arthur&#39;s Seat from the west by walking over the Meadows to the Commonwealth swimming pool and then into the park.</description>

      <description>Cul Mor and Cul Beag (Mor is Gaelic for big; Beag for small) are easily accessible hills from the road north from Ullapool. I&amp;rsquo;ve climbed them botha couple of times but, sadly, never in good weather. This walk was probably the best - not much rain but thick damp mist on the tops. We had views for about 5 minutes during a brief clearance.
We took the standard route, the path of the A835 by Knockan Crag and then up the shoulder of the hill.</description>

      <description>We were staying in Ullapool for a mountaineering club dinner and it looked like a typical dreich November day. Low cloud and no sign of a break in the sky. We debated what to do and my pal Dave said that one of the Corbetts that he had still to do was Ben Hee in Sutherland. Others decided on a low-level walk to keep below the clouds but four of us decided to head north to Ben Hee.</description>

      <description>The unexpectedly early arrival of our first grandchild in spring 2019 meant that the last two weeks has been a blur of driving up and down the A90, hospital visits, homecoming and helping the new parents adjust to sleep deprivation. Writing deadlines have been missed; social media skimmed at best and email ignored. Thankfully, Mum and baby are both fine and the baby, at least, is thriving.
I’ve had no time for outdoor wandering or photography, apart of course from baby photography.</description>

      <description>Visiting family in Edinburgh last weekend, Saturday dawned misty and gloomy. My wife and daughters decided to have what they call an ‘Edinburgh Saturday’, which consists of a leisurely lunch, a couple of hours of shopping then cocktails somewhere. I am not at all welcome (thankfully) at such gatherings so I decided that, in spite of the weather, I would get out for a walk somewhere.
One of the great things about walking around Edinburgh is its excellent bus service.</description>

      <description>Mount Keen is the nearest Munro to where we live but it’s a bit of a lump. Lochnagar is the nearest ‘interesting’ hill, which is about 90 minutes drive from our house.
Lochnagar is one of my favourite hills. I first climbed there in the 1970s in the days when I was into winter climbing and I’ve been to the top countless times since then.
 Winter climbing on Black Spout Buttress  This year, I was chatting to our (relatively) new neighbours and discovered that, although natives of Aberdeen, they had never been to the top of Lochnagar.</description>

      <description>I said I’d do it and I did. Today, I got started on a training walk for TGOC-2014. This was in an unlikely location - Scotland’s capital. We were in Edinburgh for my daughter’s birthday and I didn’t have the option of a day in the north.
I didn’t have any work today that had to be done, the sun was shining so I thought that I’d do the 7 hills of Edinburgh.</description>

      <description>Our plans today were to head home from Edinburgh but my wife decided that she&amp;rsquo;s like to go with our daughter to the Ideal Home Show in Glasgow. This did not appeal to me one bit so I had a free day for a wee dauner in the Pentlands. I wrote this post several years ago but I thought it worth preserving as it&amp;rsquo;s a relatively uncommon Pentlands walk.
I decided that, to reflect my walk around the 7 hills of Edinburgh, I would do 7 tops in the Pentlands.</description>

      <description>Scotland’s weather is notoriously fickle so when you head for the hills in November, you hope for the best but plan for the worst. Sometimes, the worst happens but sometimes you get one of these unforgettable days on the hill. Typically, you start off in poor weather wondering if you should have taken the ‘sensible’ option of a coastal walk, where you might actually see something. But then the weather improves, the clouds disappear, the landscape emerges and you know that you’ve done the right thing.</description>

      <description>Rising just over 500 metres from the North-East lowlands, Bennachie is an iconic hills for folks from Aberdeen and the surrounding area. I guess that a large chunk of the population of Aberdeen have been up Bennachie at least once and it has it’s own conservation charity, the Baillies of Bennachie.
It’s about 45 minutes drive from where I live so it’s not exactly a local hill. Nevertheless, I like to try and get up there once or twice a year for the fantastic views.</description>

      <title>West Highland Way 2012</title>

      <description>I walked the West Highland Way in the first week of May in 2012 as my first long-distance walk after many years where I only had time for day walks. I was concerned about both my fitness and over-crowding on the path. It turned out that I was still fit enough and there were fewer people than I expected. I think starting on a week-day rather than a week-end helped here.</description>

      <description>After treatment for a serious illness in 2011, I decided to walk the West Highland Way in 2012 (writeup here) to convince myself that I was still up to multi-day backpacking. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience but I never imagined that I&amp;rsquo;d ever repeat it.
However, 2 or 3 years ago my daughter, Jane, who had never previously shown much interest in outdoors activities, decided that she would like to do the walk and asked if I would do it with her.</description>

      <description>I love coastal walking and, at one time, I thought I might write a guide to the Aberdeenshire coastal path. On paper, this goes from Portsoy to St Cyrus and it should be a fantastic walk. Unfortunately, however, it’s a coastal path in name only and lots of the walk is on roads (even the busy A90) which are a fair bit from the coast. I don’t much like road walking so I’ve given up on this idea.</description>

      <title>City Wandering</title>

      <guid>https://iansomme.github.io/walks/edinburgh/city-wandering/</guid>
      <description>When I get out and about, my first preference is to get to the hills. Unfortunately, family circumstances mean that I can’t get there nearly as often as I’d like so I spend more time daunering in the lowlands rather than the highlands.
So, city walking is not my first preference but it has its own charms. Sometimes this walking is directed (e.g. the seven hills of Edinburgh) but more often than not, I like to wander aimlessly in the city, following unfamiliar streets and paths just to see where I end up.</description>

      <description>My well-intentioned idea of using public transport to access the Aberdeenshire coastal path and to walk the path in linear sections has not really worked. Short winter days and infrequent buses mean that too much precious daylight would be spent on or waiting for a bus. So, for this bit of the path, I drove to Stonehaven then walked the sections north and south from there. I’ve written it in the reverse order to my walk so the afternoon photos come first.</description>

      <guid>https://iansomme.github.io/walks/aberdeenshire/muchalls-to-stonehaven-2015/</guid>
      <description>On the ‘official’ maps of the Aberdeenshire coastal path, there’s a gap between Muchalls and Stonehaven, with the implication that you need to walk along the edge of the busy A90. But my experience is that the ‘official’ maps don’t really reflect the reality on the ground so I thought I would try to see if there was actually a coastal route.
My original idea when walking the coastal path was to do it in sections and use public transport to get to each section.</description>

      <description>The Aberdeenshire Coastal Trail stretches for about 160 miles from Cullen in the north to Montrose in the south. I have walked bits and pieces of it on days out but never in any kind of systematic way. As a national trail, it is not well documented - there are (not very good) maps available from the Aberdeenshire Council website and Gil Campbell has written briefly about it on his blog of walking around the Scottish Coast.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the heat that gets to me. My daughters, aided and abetted by their mother, insist on an almost tropical level of heat in the house at Christmas and, after being indoors for Christmas Day, I needed to get out.
So, on the 26th December, whatever the weather, I make a point of going out for a walk somewhere. On this occasiom, we are in the calm between storms and the sky was cloudless at 8am when I got out of bed.</description>

      <description>The Deeside way is a long distance path that follows the valley of the River Dee from Ballater to Duthie Park in Aberdeen. It mostly follows the old Deeside railway line which was built in the 19th century and which became well-known as Queen Victoria&amp;rsquo;s route to Balmoral Castle. It is a &amp;lsquo;work in progress&amp;rsquo; i.e it isn&amp;rsquo;t finished and there is a gap between Banchory and Potarch Bridge and a shorter gap between Aboyne and Kincardine O&amp;rsquo;Neill.</description>
