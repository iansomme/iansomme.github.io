      <description>In 2014, I wrote a short guide to some of the Scottish food that Challengers from outwith Scotland may come across. I&amp;rsquo;ve now revised this and turned it into a more general guide in the food section.
Scottish food has a bad reputation but, in the last 15 years or so, it has improved immeasurably, especially in Highland hotels and restaurants. If you eat in a reasonable restaurant, there&amp;rsquo;s every chance you will get a good meal.</description>

      <description>I wrote this short guide to some &amp;lsquo;traditional&amp;rsquo; Scottish food and drink for people planning a TGO Challenge - a cross country walk across Scotland, which I&amp;rsquo;ve done a few times. However, I think it may be of more general interest so I&amp;rsquo;ve extended it a wee bit and put it in the more general food section rather than the TGOC pages.
I won’t write here about the excellent ‘high-end’ Scottish food such as venison and langoustines, that you might get in restaurants.</description>
