      <title>Water of Leith</title>

      <description>The Water of Leith is a short river that runs from its source in the Pentlands to the Firth of Forth at Leith. There&amp;rsquo;s a path along most of it, starting at Balerno and finishing at Leith. It&amp;rsquo;s about 13 miles (19km) and flat so it&amp;rsquo;s an easy day&amp;rsquo;s walk.
As it&amp;rsquo;s a linear walk, I think it best to use Edinburgh&amp;rsquo;s excellent buses rather than a car to get to the start.</description>

      <title>Arthur&#39;s Seat</title>

      <description>Edinburgh is unusual in the it has its own hill called Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat close to the centre of the city. It&amp;rsquo;s in Queen&amp;rsquo;s Park, a large green space at the foot of the Royal Mile. I&amp;rsquo;ve walked up Arthur&amp;rsquo;s Seat countless times and in all weathers apart from torrential rain.
 I normally walk up Arthur&#39;s Seat from the west by walking over the Meadows to the Commonwealth swimming pool and then into the park.</description>

      <title>Edinburgh - an alternative view</title>

      <description>One of the first books of photographs that I bought in the 1970s was entitled &amp;lsquo;Edinburgh&amp;rsquo; by Douglas Corrance. As well as the &amp;lsquo;tourist&amp;rsquo; sights of Edinburgh, Douglas also included more intimate and quirky images that captures the people and details of the places. I really liked this approach and I&amp;rsquo;ve collected here ten images that present an alternative view of Edinburgh from that seen by most tourists to the city.</description>

      <title>Hillend to Colinton</title>

      <description>Visiting family in Edinburgh last weekend, Saturday dawned misty and gloomy. My wife and daughters decided to have what they call an ‘Edinburgh Saturday’, which consists of a leisurely lunch, a couple of hours of shopping then cocktails somewhere. I am not at all welcome (thankfully) at such gatherings so I decided that, in spite of the weather, I would get out for a walk somewhere.
One of the great things about walking around Edinburgh is its excellent bus service.</description>

      <title>The Seven Hills of Edinburgh</title>

      <description>I said I’d do it and I did. Today, I got started on a training walk for TGOC-2014. This was in an unlikely location - Scotland’s capital. We were in Edinburgh for my daughter’s birthday and I didn’t have the option of a day in the north.
I didn’t have any work today that had to be done, the sun was shining so I thought that I’d do the 7 hills of Edinburgh.</description>

      <title>Seven Pentland Hills</title>
      <link>https://iansomme.github.io/walks/edinburgh/seven_pentland_hills/</link>

      <description>Our plans today were to head home from Edinburgh but my wife decided that she&amp;rsquo;s like to go with our daughter to the Ideal Home Show in Glasgow. This did not appeal to me one bit so I had a free day for a wee dauner in the Pentlands. I wrote this post several years ago but I thought it worth preserving as it&amp;rsquo;s a relatively uncommon Pentlands walk.
I decided that, to reflect my walk around the 7 hills of Edinburgh, I would do 7 tops in the Pentlands.</description>

      <title>Photography or Digital Art</title>

      <description>When I visited Edinburgh last August, I went along to the International Exhibition of the Edinburgh Photographic Society. This is an annual event with over 3000 submissions from across the world and around about 200 acceptances. So it should represent the best of amateur photography.
Yet, when I wandered around the exhibition, I was disappointed. I reckon that at least 50% of the accepted images were ‘Digital art’, created in Photoshop or other image manipulation programs.</description>

      <title>City Wandering</title>
      <link>https://iansomme.github.io/walks/edinburgh/city-wandering/</link>

      <description>When I get out and about, my first preference is to get to the hills. Unfortunately, family circumstances mean that I can’t get there nearly as often as I’d like so I spend more time daunering in the lowlands rather than the highlands.
So, city walking is not my first preference but it has its own charms. Sometimes this walking is directed (e.g. the seven hills of Edinburgh) but more often than not, I like to wander aimlessly in the city, following unfamiliar streets and paths just to see where I end up.</description>
