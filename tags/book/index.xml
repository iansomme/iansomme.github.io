      <description>An introduction to modern software engineering
In 1981, I wrote a short book that was an introduction to software engineering for computer science students. This covered most of software engineering as it was at that time. Virtually all software was then developed in ‘projects’, where a client supplied the ‘requirements’ and the software was implemented by a separate team.
Over the years, the discipline expanded and so did my book. It was no longer just an introduction but embraced several advanced topics.</description>
