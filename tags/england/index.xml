      <description>Walks in the Lake District and Lancashire. We used to live in Northern England, close to the Lake District, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really started with digital photography and only took and occasional picture of my walks. We now visit friends there occasionally and sometimes I have time for a walk.</description>

      <description>The unexpectedly early arrival of our first grandchild in spring 2019 meant that the last two weeks has been a blur of driving up and down the A90, hospital visits, homecoming and helping the new parents adjust to sleep deprivation. Writing deadlines have been missed; social media skimmed at best and email ignored. Thankfully, Mum and baby are both fine and the baby, at least, is thriving.
Iâ€™ve had no time for outdoor wandering or photography, apart of course from baby photography.</description>
