      <description>Mallaig to Aberdeen: My original route plan
I start in Mallaig with the Bruce Watt ferry from Mallaig to Knoydart. This has a lot of memories for me as I first went on a Bruce Watt boat (called the Clansman) in the 1950s when I was just a wee boy. I had a shot of driving the boat which was great fun (that&amp;rsquo;s me in the wheelhouse).
  Driving the &#39;Clansman&#39;   I hope to stop at the pub in Inverie for a pint then over the hill to camp at Sourlies bothy.</description>

      <description>Day 1: Mallaig to Sourlies
About 30-odd Challengers set off for Knoydart.Â Experienced Challengers were chatting; newbies like myself were quieter and a bit apprehensive about what they had let themselves in for. On the ferry, I met Lindsay - a wonderful lady who had her rucksack on what looked like a golf trolley. She told me she&amp;rsquo;d recently had an operation and couldn&amp;rsquo;t carry her rucksack so she had rigged up this trolley to drag it across Scotland.</description>
