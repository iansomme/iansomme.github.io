      <description>My thoughts on the development of spaceports in environmentally sensitive areas in the Scottish Highlands.

      <description>Should there be more signposting to reduce navigation mistakes on the hills?
A tweet caught my eye a while ago about a proposal by a mountain rescue team in the Lakes to put signs up on Scafell Pike because so many people are getting lost and then calling out the mountain rescue. The reaction from the mountaineering and backpacking community was predictable outrage. Signs despoil the landscape, remove any feeling of remoteness and encourage people who donâ€™t know what they are doing onto the hills.</description>
