      <description>Life has been a wee bit busy this summer (2019). Our daughter gave birth to twins (boy and girl) at the end of July and we&amp;rsquo;ve been involved helping with them and our older grandson since then. Before that, we had decided to move to Edinburgh to be closer to family and, maybe unwisely given that we are no longer spring chickens, bought a house that needs complete renovation. So the summer has been spent working on a house, trying (with no success) to sell a house and helping look after babies and a two-year old.</description>
