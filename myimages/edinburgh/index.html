        <h1 class="title">Edinburgh - an alternative view</h1>
        <div class="content"><p>One of the first books of photographs that I bought in the 1970s was entitled &lsquo;Edinburgh&rsquo; by Douglas Corrance. As well as the &lsquo;tourist&rsquo; sights of Edinburgh, Douglas also included more intimate and quirky images that captures the people and details of the places. I really liked this approach and I&rsquo;ve collected here ten images that present an alternative view of Edinburgh from that seen by most tourists to the city.</p>
<figure> 
<img class = "myimg horiz" src="/images/edinburgh/Bruntsfield-rainbow.jpg" alt="Bruntsfield-rainbow" />
<figcaption class="mycap para">
Edinburgh has retained much of its character because people live in the city and not just in the suburbs. Most of the city dwellers live in tenement flats but until I got this shot of flats with a rainbow, I'd never been happy with simple tenement pictures.
</figcaption></figure>
<figure> 
<img class = "myimg horiz" src="/images/edinburgh/Tenements.jpg" alt="Tenement reflections" />
<figcaption class="mycap para">
Another more abstract view of Edinburgh tenements, reflecting in a parked car. 
</figcaption></figure>
<figure> 
<img class = "myimg vert" src="/images/edinburgh/Canny-Mans.jpg" alt="Canny-Mans" />
<figcaption class="mycap para">
Edinburgh has all sorts of pubs from seedy dives through Victorian marvels to ultra-modern bars. The Canny Mans in Morningside is one of the quirkiest. It was established in 1871 and is still owned by the same family. I liked this image because of the intimacy of the couple sitting at the bar.
</figcaption></figure>
<figure> 
<img class = "myimg horiz" src="/images/edinburgh/Bruntsfield-links.jpg" alt="Bruntsfield-links" />
<figcaption class="mycap para">
Bruntsfield links was established as a golf course in (reputedly) the 15th century and there is a still a public pitch and putt course where you can play without a fee. The links are a route from Brunstfield to the University and City Centre and they've been planted with delightful spring flowers. 
</figcaption></figure>
<figure> 
<img class = "myimg horiz" src="/images/edinburgh/Golfers.jpg" alt="Golf course" />
<figcaption class="mycap para">
I'm not one for golf - best described as 'a good walk spoiled' but golf courses are green areas
in the city and the Scottish access laws mean that anyone can walk over them. This is Duddingston
golf course from Arthur's Seat. I love the long shadows and I wonder if the ridges mean these were
once lazy beds for crop growing.
</figcaption></figure>
<figure> 
<img class = "myimg horiz" src="/images/edinburgh/Waverley-Station.jpg" alt="Waverley station" />
<figcaption class="mycap para">
Waverley station is Edinburgh's main station, used by commuters and visitors. I liked the lady in red here striding
out very purposely but it was a very busy and confusing coloured image. So, to emphasise the main subject,
I did a wee bit photoshopping to turn most of the image mono. 
</figcaption></figure>
<figure> 
<img class = "myimg horiz" src="/images/edinburgh/Misty-Meadows.jpg" alt="Meadows in the mist" />
<figcaption class="mycap para">
I was walking across the Meadows one misty November evening and, as usual, there were lots of people heading 
home. I think this image really captures the atmosphere of the evening. 
</figcaption></figure>
<figure> 
<img class = "myimg horiz" src="/images/edinburgh/Garden-party.jpg" alt="Hollywood garden party" />
<figcaption class="mycap para">
I'm not the kind of person who gets invited to garden parties but my wife was invited to the Hollywood garden party and
I thought it would be an interesting experience. I took this picture as it was coming to an end and I think it captures
the diversity of people at these occasions. I really like the photography of Martin Parr and
I was flattered when this was compared to his work. 
</figcaption></figure>
<figure> 
<img class = "myimg horiz" src="/images/edinburgh/Graveyard.jpg" alt="Wariston cemetery" />
<figcaption class="mycap para">
Edinburgh Council have more of less completely stopped maintaining all of the city cemeteries and are letting
nature reclaim the space. This means that they are much more interesting than they would be with mown grass and
neat gravestones. This is Warriston cemetery - obviously this is the grave of a wealthy Edinburgh citizen.
</figcaption></figure>
<figure> 
<img class = "myimg horiz" src="/images/edinburgh/Summit-selfie.jpg" alt="Tenement reflections" />
<figcaption class="mycap para">
It's not enough now to walk up Arthur's Seat - to demonstrate to the world that you've been up there,
you need to take a selfie. I like the simplicity of this image with the woman silhouetted in front
of the single cloud that's lit by the setting sun.
