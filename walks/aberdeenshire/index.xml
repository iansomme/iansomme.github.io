      <description>In 2016 there was a proposal to build a 26-turbine windfarm in Glen Dye. I&amp;rsquo;d never been there and I thought that I should have a walk there before the monstrosity was built. I&amp;rsquo;m in favour of renewable energy and wind farms have their place in this. However, I think they should be built in areas of low amenity - not in wild land.
I decided to do a round trip over Clachnaben then from there drop down into Glen Dye.</description>

      <description>Rising just over 500 metres from the North-East lowlands, Bennachie is an iconic hills for folks from Aberdeen and the surrounding area. I guess that a large chunk of the population of Aberdeen have been up Bennachie at least once and it has it’s own conservation charity, the Baillies of Bennachie.
It’s about 45 minutes drive from where I live so it’s not exactly a local hill. Nevertheless, I like to try and get up there once or twice a year for the fantastic views.</description>

      <description>I love coastal walking and, at one time, I thought I might write a guide to the Aberdeenshire coastal path. On paper, this goes from Portsoy to St Cyrus and it should be a fantastic walk. Unfortunately, however, it’s a coastal path in name only and lots of the walk is on roads (even the busy A90) which are a fair bit from the coast. I don’t much like road walking so I’ve given up on this idea.</description>

      <description>I ripped my Paramo jacket on a gate and handed it in to Hilltrek in Aboyne for repair (recommended). I picked it up and, as the sun was shining and I had a couple of hours to spare, I thought that I’d have a wee walk in Glen Tanar.
We don’t live that far from Glen Tanar but I tend to forget about it and head further west to Ballater or Braemar.</description>

      <description>My well-intentioned idea of using public transport to access the Aberdeenshire coastal path and to walk the path in linear sections has not really worked. Short winter days and infrequent buses mean that too much precious daylight would be spent on or waiting for a bus. So, for this bit of the path, I drove to Stonehaven then walked the sections north and south from there. I’ve written it in the reverse order to my walk so the afternoon photos come first.</description>

      <title>Muchalls to Stonehaven 2015</title>

      <description>On the ‘official’ maps of the Aberdeenshire coastal path, there’s a gap between Muchalls and Stonehaven, with the implication that you need to walk along the edge of the busy A90. But my experience is that the ‘official’ maps don’t really reflect the reality on the ground so I thought I would try to see if there was actually a coastal route.
My original idea when walking the coastal path was to do it in sections and use public transport to get to each section.</description>

      <description>The Aberdeenshire Coastal Trail stretches for about 160 miles from Cullen in the north to Montrose in the south. I have walked bits and pieces of it on days out but never in any kind of systematic way. As a national trail, it is not well documented - there are (not very good) maps available from the Aberdeenshire Council website and Gil Campbell has written briefly about it on his blog of walking around the Scottish Coast.</description>

      <title>Clachnaben - December 2013</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the heat that gets to me. My daughters, aided and abetted by their mother, insist on an almost tropical level of heat in the house at Christmas and, after being indoors for Christmas Day, I needed to get out.
So, on the 26th December, whatever the weather, I make a point of going out for a walk somewhere. On this occasiom, we are in the calm between storms and the sky was cloudless at 8am when I got out of bed.</description>

      <title>Ballater to Aboyne</title>

      <description>The Deeside way is a long distance path that follows the valley of the River Dee from Ballater to Duthie Park in Aberdeen. It mostly follows the old Deeside railway line which was built in the 19th century and which became well-known as Queen Victoria&amp;rsquo;s route to Balmoral Castle. It is a &amp;lsquo;work in progress&amp;rsquo; i.e it isn&amp;rsquo;t finished and there is a gap between Banchory and Potarch Bridge and a shorter gap between Aboyne and Kincardine O&amp;rsquo;Neill.</description>
