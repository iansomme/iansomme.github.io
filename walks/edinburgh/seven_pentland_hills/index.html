        <h1 class="title">Seven Pentland Hills</h1>
        <div class="content"><p>Our plans today were to head home from Edinburgh but my wife decided that she&rsquo;s like to go with our daughter to the Ideal Home Show in Glasgow. This did not appeal to me one bit so I had a free day for a wee dauner in the Pentlands. I wrote this post several years ago but I thought it worth preserving as it&rsquo;s a relatively uncommon Pentlands walk.</p>
<p>I decided that, to reflect my walk around the 7 hills of Edinburgh, I would do 7 tops in the Pentlands. The excellent Edinburgh bus service means that a linear walk is easy so I caught a 44 bus to Balerno to start my walk. My plan was to walk over Hare Hill, Black Hill, Bell&rsquo;s Hill, Harbour Hill, Capelaw Hill, Allermuir Hill and finally Caerketton Hill. The forecast was good - dry, with sunshine in the afternoon.</p>
<p>I often find that the hardest part of navigation is getting started and this was no exception. I got off the bus in the wrong place in Balerno and ended up walking around Threipmuir reservoir to get started. I think it was an understandable mistake - I was planning to start near Harelaw Castle and I followed a sign for Harlaw - but they were not the same place. Finally, I got to Easter Bavelaw Farm and got started.</p>

<figcaption class="mycap horiz">
<p>Hare Hill was my first hill and, by the signs of things, it isn&rsquo;t often visited. By chance, I came across this memorial to an aircrew who died in a crash in 1943. I googled this later and found that this was a German plane that crashed after a failed raid on Leith docks.</p>

<figcaption class="mycap horiz">
 A few minutes after finding the memorial I was on the summit of Hare Hill.
</figcaption></figure>
<p>There was a big drop down before Black Hill, with a short and steep section where I really missed my walking poles.
I stopped for lunch out of the wind, when the sun threatened to shine but it never managed to break through the clouds. There was a path part of the way to the summit but then it petered out in the heather.</p>

The summit of Black Hill - simply an undulation in the high moorland.

<p>Another big drop into the glen before the next hill - Bell&rsquo;s Hill. But there was a reasonable path from the glen to the summit.</p>

<p>Things got a bit easier after this - it became more of a high-level walk with fewer big drops between the hills. I hadn&rsquo;t seen anyone on the hills so far but on Harbour Hill, I was overtaken by some fell runners.Â I got the first views over Edinburgh from here.</p>

<figcaption class="mycap horiz">
Capelaw Hill was a bit bigger so it was a bit of a climb from Harbour Hill. The summit was marked by this strange metal post.
</figcaption></figure>
<p>On to Allermuir Hill, where there was an indicator that showed what could be seen on a clear day. Unfortunately, the promised sunshine never appeared and there wasn&rsquo;t a great deal to see from the top.</p>

<p>Finally, my last hill was Caerketton Hill, the nearest to the road and the only hill where I saw more than a handful of people. Good views over the city - I must go back there sometime when it&rsquo;s clear. I dropped down to Hillend through coconut scented whin bushes to catch a bus back into the city - .</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t been in the Pentlands for more than 30 years - since I lived in Edinburgh - and I had forgotten how many ups and downs there were. They are not the most exciting hills - quite a lot of heather and bog - but it was a good walk. Disappointing weather - dull all day with a cold east wind, which meant that I didn&rsquo;t linger on any of the tops. I guess I walked about 20km with more than 1000 m of ascent.</p>
