      <description>Courgettes (Zucchini if you are Italian or American) in Scotland are a bit unreliable but the warm weather this summer has really suited them. Expecting a poor crop, we planted 6 plants and now we are overwhelmed with yellow courgettes. Simple roast courgettes are really nice but more variety is needed so we&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for things to do with them.
 Courgettes-tomatoes-and-shallots.   The simplest recipe - chop up a few courgettes, some tomatoes and a couple of shallots.</description>
