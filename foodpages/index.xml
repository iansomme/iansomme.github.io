      <description>A while ago, I set myself a 365 photographic challenge where I photographed something that was food related every day for a year and posted it on what was then my first blog. I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked at these for years but I just checked and it&amp;rsquo;s still there.
I have done bits and pieces of food photography since then but nothing for the past few years. I&amp;rsquo;m still interested in food and cooking but haven&amp;rsquo;t had a lot of time for it and lunches especially are usually rushed affairs.</description>

      <title>Scottish Delicacies</title>

      <description>I wrote this short guide to some &amp;lsquo;traditional&amp;rsquo; Scottish food and drink for people planning a TGO Challenge - a cross country walk across Scotland, which I&amp;rsquo;ve done a few times. However, I think it may be of more general interest so I&amp;rsquo;ve extended it a wee bit and put it in the more general food section rather than the TGOC pages.
I won’t write here about the excellent ‘high-end’ Scottish food such as venison and langoustines, that you might get in restaurants.</description>
